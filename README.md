This case study analyzes a Google Play Store dataset to identify the key factors that influence app success. Using data analytics techniques, the study explores how characteristics such as app ratings, size, category, price, reviews, and update frequency affect user engagement and install counts. Data processing steps included cleaning missing values, converting data types, removing duplicates, standardizing categories, and formatting dates for analysis.

The project answers basic, intermediate, and advanced analytical questions using Python, revealing patterns in user behavior and market trends. Insights show that highly rated apps often receive more installs and reviews, while certain categories consistently perform better. App pricing impacts ratings differently for free and paid apps, and frequent updates correlate with better user satisfaction. Sentiment analysis of user reviews helps understand user emotions and motivations, highlighting common issues and praised features.

Business recommendations encourage focusing on high-performing categories, optimizing app size, implementing an appropriate pricing strategy, and maintaining regular updates to improve user satisfaction. Ethical guidelines emphasize protecting user privacy and minimizing algorithmic bias. Interdisciplinary collaboration with domain experts and continuous improvement in analytical methods help ensure accurate and meaningful insights.
